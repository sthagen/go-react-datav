#  datav.dev docs

datav.dev uses [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) for its documentation. Here is how you can run the project locally: 

1. Clone this repo

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/opendatav/datav.dev.git
    ```

2. Go into the project root directory

    ```sh
    cd datav.dev
    ```

3. Install JS dependencies

    ```sh
    yarn
    ```

4. Start the dev server

    ```sh
    yarn dev
    ```

Alternatively you can generate a static export of the documentation using the `yarn export` command. The export will be saved in the `out` folder.
